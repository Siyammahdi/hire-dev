              How We Work
            </h2>
            <p className="my-5 text-gray-300">
              Every project begins with a conversation. We always aim for long
              terms relationships so getting to know our clients, their business
              and what they want to achieve, is crucial. There is no red tape,
              we aim for efficiency. Once we sign an NDA we figure out how we
              can help. <br />
              As a company, we love Agile as a methodology and as a mindset. We
              use both, in different doses, depending on the project. Working in
              iterations, incrementally, allows for enough flexibility to build
              the right product in budget and on time, without compromising on
              changes that occur in a dynamic market. Working remotely in IT
              outsourcing makes Agile even more valuable, especially when
              clients or team members are in different parts of the world, with
              timezone gaps.
